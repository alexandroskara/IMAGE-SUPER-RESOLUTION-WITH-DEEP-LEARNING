# IMAGE-SUPER-RESOLUTION-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING
Image super resolution with deep learning using CNN networks and LISTA algorithm. Implemented with Tensorflow. 
This project has been implemented during my undergraduate thesis. Special thanks to my teacher L.P. Konti and his assinsant E.Tsiligianni for their help. 

Purpose of this project is to create a deep network model which is capable to produce super resolution images given as input low resolution images. The quality of the producted image is measured by PSNR metric, so i can compare my method with other implementations. The result of this model is very intresting  at optical quality as well as at PSNR values.
